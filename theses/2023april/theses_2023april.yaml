- "While reconstructing urban environments, the accuracy of our model is strongly\
  \ related with the quality of the input data. Their initial type for this process\
  \ is the footprints of the buildings, which are typically used to raise them, either\
  \ through manual or automated methods. However, these data could be biased and when\
  \ we perform a Computational Fluid Dynamic simulation (CFD), could have impact on\
  \ our results. In our case, real-world building footprints will be used to define\
  \ these biases with the uncertainty of raw data. Additionally, the probability approach\
  \ for representing and quantifying this uncertainty will be examined. The CEDVAL database\
  \ is an example of a canonical case for the simulations, in which the building footprints\
  \ could be perturbed based on mean from point cloud data, in a deterministic way (rotation\
  \ and displacement). A CFD simulation on such a canonical case would typically involve\
  \ the following steps: 1) Preparation of our\
  \ geometry, 2)Generation of the mesh, 3) Boundary conditions (fluid properties, inlet\
  \ velocity and other relevant parameters), 4) Numerical solution by solving a system\
  \ of algebraic equations and 5) Post-processing, like visualization of the flow patterns\
  \ and comparing the simulation results with the experimental data from the CEDVAL\
  \ database. The data that will be compared are flow velocity, pressure, turbulent\
  \ kinetic energy, dissipation rate and turbulent viscosity. The effects will be examined\
  \ across multiple wind directions."

- "Global Navigation Satellite Systems is a spatial data acquisition technique, mostly\
  \ used in fields such as land surveying. One of the main components of this techniques\
  \ is the satellite visibility, which refers to the connection between the satellite\
  \ and the ground receiver. It is well known that the results GNSS positioning systems\
  \ are often unreliable in urban areas due to the dense coverage of obstacles. Such\
  \ obstacles can include buildings, trees, topographic details etc. These obstacles\
  \ can obstruct and reflect the signals coming from the satellites to the ground\
  \ receivers, such as smartphones, which affect the quality of the performance of\
  \ the GNSS service. \nThe results of the analysis of the behavior of these signals\
  \ in the urban environment can help simple users of GNSS positioning systems understand\
  \ why and in which areas of the cities the satellite signals are the weakest or\
  \ non-existent at all. This research can also be used in the future to point out\
  \ the weak aspects of the satellite constellations and then improve them.\nThis\
  \ research will be focused on implementing a strategy, similar to that of ray tracing\
  \ or shadow matching, to analyze the obstruction of the lines of sight from satellites,\
  \ using different locations in the point cloud sample. For this study, the ANH4\
  \ set of point clouds will be used. The GNSS study part will consist of the constellation\
  \ of satellites, taking into consideration details such as the study of their orbits,\
  \ and a ground receiver."

- "Point clouds are widely used in a variety of fields nowadays. This rich data resource\
  \ has multiple functions for different disciplines. The company Van Oord uses Light\
  \ Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data of drones to generate point clouds for several\
  \ purposes within their projects, such as volumetric calculations, anomaly detection,\
  \ and distance measurements.\n\nDespite the fact that point clouds are used for\
  \ a variety of applications, the data is often underused. A point cloud can namely\
  \ function as an extensive data resource with potential use cases that are not explored\
  \ yet. This comes together in the concept of smart point clouds (SPC) (Poux et al.,\
  \ 2016). It sees the explorative value of point clouds through the addition of semantics,\
  \ and integration of information flows from different directions. The inclusion\
  \ of human observation can thus be integrated into the semantics of the point cloud.\n\
  \ \nThis research will therefore explore the possibilities of SPC by integrating\
  \ the knowledge of present disciplines within Van Oord. Van Oord has engineers operating\
  \ in the fields of dredging, offshore (wind), and infrastructure. This means that\
  \ a variety of expertise is available within the company, which integration can\
  \ be beneficial for identifying new insights into the current use of point cloud\
  \ data. The aim of this thesis is to optimize the usage of point clouds acquired\
  \ through LIDAR data via drones."

- "Land Surface Temperature (LST) of a specific location is affected by different\
  \ parameters, such as the urban design, along with land cover and sub-surface parameters.\
  \ Therefore LST can be a proper indicator for understanding the thermal behavior\
  \ of different urban climate zones. This thesis aims to classify urban Local Climate\
  \ Zones (LCZ\u2019s) using deep learning and spatio-temporal thermal imagery. The\
  \ use of an integrated RNN-CNN deep learning methodology is proposed to identify\
  \ both the spatial and temporal characteristics of the thermal behavior of LCZ\u2019\
  s in an urban environment. By using high frequency temporal LST data, this research\
  \ can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the thermal behavior of different\
  \ LCZ\u2019s over time. Training data of different urban environments will be taken\
  \ into consideration, to ensure that the deep learning methodology is versatile."
