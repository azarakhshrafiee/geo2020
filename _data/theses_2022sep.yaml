- 'In the field of massive point cloud data management, the majority of point cloud
  data is currently done at the file level, but an efficient database-based solution
  is crucial. Database management system (DBMS) has advantages in functionalities,
  optimised disk IO strategies and automatic parallelization in the query executions.

  PostgreSQL is a desirable database to store point clouds, as it is open-sourced,
  has spatial extension and supports arrays for all its scalar types, allowing us
  to store additional values per point, like intensity and gps time. In some previous
  studies, the application of space filling curves for point cloud data has been explored
  and tested, but queries are usually not efficient enough. In this research, the
  approach is to split the space filling curve key in a head and tail part and make
  groups of points inside the database based on the head, therefore to make the storage
  and manipulation more efficient. The expected outcome includes a storage data model,
  a Python-based data importer and a scientific benchmark. The benchmark will use
  AHN2 dataset, and be performed on query, add, update and delete.'

- "In the past decade, there has been growing interest in creating what is known as\

  \ twin is an exact digital representation of the real world and all its physical\
  \ attributes and relationships and dynamic phenomena. This includes services such\
  \ utility networks, charged with the transportation of goods such as electricity,\
  \ data, water, gas, sewage and other commodities that help a city function. In these\
  \ utility networks it is important for them to be accessible for maintenance reasons,\
  \ or to remove and replace them completely. The maintenance of these networks can\
  \ become problematic when the exact (2D, but actually 3D) geographic position of\

- Geometric algorithms are usually described and designed for infinite precision.
  However, this is not the case when it comes to the implementation because of floating-point
  arithmetic, which will cause problems when robust solutions are desired. A common
  solution is to generate objects with finite-precision estimated coordinates. Iterated
  snap rounding (ISR) is such a method to convert infinite-precision to finite-precision,
  so as to obtain well separated vertices and cleaner geometric arrangements. Currently
  there are some implementations, for example - CGAL. It is robust but there seems
  to be room for improvement in efficiency. For instance, for a map of the USA (containing
  about 56 polygons), the average run time is about 78.64s. This is slow in practice
  (where datasets typically contain thousands of polygons). Related to this, Constrained
  Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) has been previously used for repairing polygons (prepair)
  and planar partitions (pprepair), which gives the inspiration to apply CDT on snap
  rounding process. The aim of this thesis is to explore the possibility of using
  CDT to perform further optimization. CDT will firstly be constructed as the base
  data structure, the topological relationships of the triangles will allow to identify
  the situations where snap is desired. Then the snap operation can be realized by
  modifying the CDT (e.g., collapsing a particularly thin triangle into a point or
  an edge), which may be theoretically more efficient.

  \ Traditional MVS methods that rely on photo-consistent metrics to establish these\
  \ correspondences achieve remarkably accurate results, yet are weak on producing\
  \ a complete model reconstruction. This is because reflective, low-textured and\
  \ specular regions of the image make matching impossible, leading to invalid depth\

- A geodata ecosystem consists of data from a wide variety of stakeholders from public,
  private, academia, and other sectors and each of them contributes to the ecosystem
  with different levels of openness. However, the majority of annually created data,
  are controlled by companies and not easily accessible or reusable for other stakeholders.  The
  European Commission is trying to address the fragmentation of data between stakeholders
  by introducing the concept of Data Spaces, in an attempt to connect dispersed geographical
  data from different actors, from the private and public sectors. One of the objectives
  of the EU Green Deal Data Space is to create a sustainable governance scheme that
  connects national, regional, and local data ecosystems and enables public and private
  stakeholders to access relevant data and to develop cross-sector data services to
  address the challenges the EU Green Deal brings, such us making Europe climate-neutral
  and ensuring a just and inclusive transition. This thesis will contribute to this
  objective by exploring the barriers and incentives for the private sector to participate
  in  the Green Deal Data Space. Additionally a strategy will be designed to satisfy
  these requirements. The requirements will be developed by qualitative research from
  surveys and interviews with private companies that would potentially be part of
  the data space.

  face pressing challenges and add economic and social value to their assets. A powerful
  tool to assist urban planners and decision makers in city management, achieving
  sustainability and tackling environmental and socio-economic issues, are urban digital
  twins. An urban digital twin replicates the real - world 3D built environment with
  the addition of smart city and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as sensors,
  that update this digital platform in accordance with the real - life processes and
  functions. Therefore, sensor data input is the crucial factor that transforms a
  static 3D city model to a dynamic urban digital twin.

  A main issue that needs to be addressed in present-day digital twins is the lack
  of standardization and interoperability. Therefore, in this research, an attempt
  will be made to facilitate both of the aforementioned aspects in an urban digital
  twin by using widely accepted standards such as OGC SensorThingsAPI and OGC 3D Tile
  standard to integrate sensor measurements into a 3D city model platform. The main

- 'Arguably, two of the most interesting fields in machine learning right now is the
  development of differentiable 3d reconstruction, and stylistic rendering. Implicit Differentiable
  Rendering (IDR) recreates 3d geometry, camera parameters, and color and reflectance
  of the object, requiring only masked images as input. The geometry is modeled using the zero level set of 
  a NN, and the material using a neural renderer. The renderer of two different models
  can be swapped to create geometry from one scene with appearance from the other.
  Stylistic rendering is all about applying styling, artistic characteristics, to
  a scene. Style representation correlates features between different layers of a CNN, which can
  be used to reconstruct styling while keeping content representation from another input image.
  If it possible to swap renderers for IDR, is it then possible to instead introduce
  a stylistic renderer? That is the question that I will be exploring. Something similar has been
  performed for NeRF, applying styling to the view synthesis created. I will explore if a similar
  method be implemented to IDR, either as a renderer or to the ouput images. It could also be
  possible to look at texture mapping the styling. To simplify the process, fast style transfer
  can be used, which only requires one forward pass for the content reconstruction.'

- The aim of this study is to improve an LADM 3D prototype system on the example of
  selected city districts. In land administration, 3D data visualisation is needed
  in many cases to represent the real world. Cesium is widely used to display 3D data
  that is more complicated than 2D. However, when there are millions of buildings,
  it takes a long time to retrieve and load the data. The research revolves around
  the possibility of storing both geometries and attributes in a database. To achieve
  this approach, the data will be sent to the client via a server dealing with 3D
  geospatial data. This proposed method would possibly speed up loading time and interaction.
  Literature research on geometry representation and render object triangulation will
  be conducted, also GeoWeb and existing applications such as 3DCityDB web map client
  and 3D BAG viewer. Based on this, efficient indexing of spatial data will be studied,
  such as R-tree, which helps retrieve data from the database faster. Methodologies
  and libraries related to theories above will be explored in practice. It is also
  expected to avoid potential problems such as data redundancy, data inconsistency
  and error. In addition, vario-scale will also be studied, possibly implementing
  aggregation when zooming out and in. Also worth noting the semantic information
  can be ambiguous due to the legal meaning of spatial plans. To validate the proposed
  system architecture, the improved prototype will be compared with the previous version.
